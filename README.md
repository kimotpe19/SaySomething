# SaySomething ðŸ’¬
SaySomething is a simple cowsay-inspired program that generates given text in a speech bubble.

```
 _____________
/             \
|Hello, World!|
\__________  /
           \/  
```
 *An example of an output given.*

## Prerequisites
- Git
  
- Something that can run JVM
  - ...along with that obviously JVM
 
- Some sort of terminal (or another environment like BlueJ)

## How to get this running
- First, clone the repository with Git.
```git clone https://github.com/kimotpe19/SaySomething.git```

- Secondly, open your terminal of choice and CD into the directory `SaySomething`.

- Next, run the command in order to compile SaySomething.java. You only need to do this once unless you edit it.
```javac SaySomething.java```

- Finally, run SaySomething by typing:
```java SaySomething```

The program should now pop up!
